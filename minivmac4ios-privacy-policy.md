## 1. Introduction

This privacy policy explains that Mini vMac for iOS does not collect, store, or share any personal information. When you use Mini vMac for iOS, everything is processed on your own device, with all data stored locally.

Mini vMac for iOS is derived from [Mini vMac](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/index.html), and licensed under the [GNU General Public License v2.0](https://github.com/zydeco/minivmac4ios/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

## 2. Information Collection and Use

Mini vMac for iOS does not collect, track, or process any personal data or sensitive information about its users. No data is sent to me or any third-party service from within the software.

All operations are handled locally on the user's device, and no data is sent to the developer or any third-party service. Mini vMac works with the files that are stored inside its own documents container, accessible in the “Mini vMac” folder under “On my iPhone/iPad” in the iOS Files app.

## 3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Mini vMac for iOS does not use cookies or any tracking technologies to monitor user activity or preferences.

## 4. Third-Party Services

Mini vMac for iOS does not integrate with third-party services that would collect or share user data. However, if you access third-party websites or services through links within the software (i.e. the links in the About screen), those third-party sites have their own privacy policies.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If I make any changes to this policy in the future, I will post the updated version here and mention it in the release notes. Since Mini vMac is free software, use of it does not require acceptance of any policy or license agreement, including this one.
