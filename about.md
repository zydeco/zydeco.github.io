This is the personal site of [Jesús A. Álvarez](https://twitter.com/maczydeco), where I post about my software, mostly.


It is created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using a slightly modified
[Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme with some icons from [Simple Line Icons](https://thesabbir.github.io/simple-line-icons/), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
