It seems my â™¥ for markdown has moved me to redo my site using
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), I think it looks slightly better than before.

I recently found a backup of my old subversion server and uploaded
[some](https://github.com/zydeco/libres) [of](https://github.com/zydeco/libmfs)
[my](https://github.com/zydeco/bootxchanger)
[old](https://github.com/zydeco/newtonkbd-iphone)
[projects](https://github.com/zydeco/ipanic) to GitHub, at least some that
could still be of interest.
