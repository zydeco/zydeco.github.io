title: Mini vMac for iOS 2.0
---

{% include youtube.html id="w9U42hqhdzA" %}

After many years and a few attempts, I've updated my port of Mini vMac to iOS
9, adding some new features:

* Works on iOS 7 and later
* No longer requires jailbreak
* Speed control
* External keyboard support
* Import/export disk images
* Universal UI for both iPhone and iPad

If you want to try it you'll have to download the source and build it yourself,
since it's not allowed on the App Store.

Find more about it [here](/minivmac).
